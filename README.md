# Ss7

Welcome to SS7 Gem  :)

Hi This is AR(Anand Raja)
This is my first Gem. This Gem is used to manipulate SS7 point codes.
You can convert Decimal number to Hexa decimal, Octal, Binary and SS7 7-7 point code and vice-versa


Suggetions are welcome to improve this gem better.

Thank you for using my Gem, by AR

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
